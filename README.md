# Android-Age-Classification
Age Classification App using Native Android. The quantized .tflite model was trained and generated using [TensorFlow Lite Model Maker](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/tutorials/model_maker_image_classification).
Face databases used: [UTKFace](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) combined with [Appa-Real](http://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.es/dataset/26/description/).
